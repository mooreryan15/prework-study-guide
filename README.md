## Usage

This Prework Study Guide can be used as a tool for myself and classmates to study and as notes to look back on is any issues arise. Each section contains notes about specific topics we learned in the prework such as HTML, CSS. Javascript, and Git. Another thing you may see, is that you can open the DevTools console and see the JavaScript running. It lists out the topics we learned about and we can choose one topic for us to study.
